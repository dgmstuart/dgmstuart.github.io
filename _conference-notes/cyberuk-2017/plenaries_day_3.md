## Panel Discussion: "Delivering the Strongest Link"

- The attackers focus on people, process and technology (probably better than
  the rest of us do)

- "What does it look like to put people first"
  - Business asks people to take personal responsibility for their work,
    Security intsead acts as C&C - clash of cultures
  - Shift: listen to and engage with staff to understand the reason that
    they're not complying with policies
  - Reaction to noncompliance is to run awareness campaigns: these don't work,
    because awareness often isn't the problem
  - Give a company the ability to lock things down and they will lock
    EVERYTHING down - unusable
    - IT don't trust users to not make mistakes
  - "shadow security" - people finding their _own_ ways of protecting their
    stuff
  - Analogy to Health and Safety - a super innovative thing at the time - we
    need something equivalent for security

- Role of boards
  - Need to pass these ideas down into the supply chain. Otherwise we're just
    'hiding the mess'
  - It's not "deep technical expertise or nothing"
  - Need to get rid of compliance culture
  - "It's not black and white. We are taking risks: what are those risks"
  - Need to find _why_ it matters to the board:
    - Don't start with compliance: start with risks, and the way it helps you
      move faster with more confidence
    - Risk is conflated with lack of compliance

- ?
  - Security is seen as a pain because the sec community treats risk as a
    checkbox exercise: why should anyone else care
    - conversation is one-way
  - need scalable tools to allow SMEs and small business to benefit
  - Don't burden SMEs with a load of governance - they can't handle it

- Cyber skills shortage
  - Mid-career pivots
  - Need cybersec ability in Law, medicine etc
  - Massive lack of diversity of skills in cyber professionals
    - Need to stop "having a go" and bring in specialists
  - If people keep viewing this as something superhuman, they'll never think
    it's something that they can do

- Do we underestimate the value of face-time
  - People remember personal stories
    - War stories, personal experiences
  - Humans speaking in person in a trusted closed circle are more likely to
    share near-misses
  - Fear campaigns: if people are afraid but don't have the skills to mitigate
    risks then you don't get good results
  - Send the right people: middle aged man in a suit is unlikely to get a team
    of devs to open up to them
  - Need to make sure that people are engaging in open conversations because if not then

 - Advice for CSOs
   - Spend a lot of time understanding all parts of the _business_ - not just
     the bits falling in security domain
   - Move beyond red/amber/green
   - Stop perpetuating the security silo: it's everybody's problem
