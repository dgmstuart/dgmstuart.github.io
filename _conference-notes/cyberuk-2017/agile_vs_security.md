## Intro

- Can regulators be Agile? Can they keep up?
  - Probably not!

## Panel Questions

- Microsoft: millenials - don't want to talk to greybeard security experts
  - Provide tools, guidance processes to support building things securely
- Rather than being "security police", focus should be on supporting teams
  build in a secure way
- "Accreditation is what is driving security"
  - we're doing it wrong
  - no consensus what good security looks like in an agile environment
  - Technology should be driving security
  - If assurance people don't talk to technology people...
- how do you deal with security stories which always get leapfrogged
  - microsoft: Default stories get added to every sprint
    - Also they make individual teams accountable for when the read team owns
      their stuff.
      - This is maybe not a good idea - doesn't help to blame devs
- "How easy can we make it to develop security?"

## Wrap up question

What single thing could we do to improve security in Agile

- Resource it: need more people
- Show developers the effects of their decisions
- Collaboration: Devs, security, features, everyone talking the same language
- Kill the IT healthcheck
  - it's driving bad behaviours
- Learn to build software 100X better than currently
