_Awesome sketchnotes by [@studionetting](http://instagram.com/p/tcUpBuNkEl/)_

* Getting stuck in cycles of task completion - head down - "daily execution".
* This time next year wp will be 1/5 of the internet.
* Freelancers, professionals - will be unable to keep up with the rate of demand
* Most WP shops: 1-2 years - achieve saturation: then it's head down - spending time in github, hipchat etc.
* Coming out of a conference inspired, but 2 days later, back in the grind
* Write down the things you're interested in: Taking an inventory
* What's important for your self development?
* Point at which you see an article isn't often the point at which you're able to read it - soln: instapaper etc.
* Task consolodation. Trello board columns:
    * future: Interested but not ready to commit time
    * Am prepared to invest time
    * Working on now
    * This week - stuff that's been done

* 'Epics' - Executing on one significant big-picture thing a day

* Rescuetime - tracks time on computer: categorises activities e.g. code, reading
    * Assign a productivity value to different kinds of activity
    * Redefine this in order to gameify optimising the headline productivity value

* Summary: being reactive vs actively pursuing opportunities and ideas
