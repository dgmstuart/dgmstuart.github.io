_I'm at [Bath Ruby 2015](http://2015.bathruby.org/), live blogging some of the
talks_

* Brains are just not very good at working with several complex ideas
  concurrently
* Abstraction is our solution to this
* Numbers are a _property_ of sets (?) of things. It doesn't matter how we
  arrange the things, or how big they are
* We build other concepts on top of our idea of number: e.g. successor - a way
  to generate new numbers. gt/lt can be built from the idea of successors
* These abstractions allow us to predict what would happen in reality when
  certain actions occur: we can do the 'work' in the 'abstract world' rather
  than doing it in the real world and observing the result.
* Recognise patterns. Some patterns can be generalised to apply to whole
  classes of items (e.g. all natural numbers)
* You don't need to remember the details of _why_ a particular formula works:
  it doesn't matter: you can use it without understanding why it's true
* A _walk_ across a graph is a sequence of visits from node to node along
  their adjacent edges
* A _connected graph_ is one where there exists a walk between any pair of notes
* A _trail_ is a walk which doesn't repeat traversing edges
* An _Euleurian trail_ is a walk which visits every node and uses every edge
* Mathematics: "spot patterns, build reusable abstractions"
* Abstractions help us take complex things from the real world and reconstruct
  them in our heads so that we cal (?reason about them?)
* Idea of the _honest_ abstraction - the one which 'honestly' models your
  problem.
* The _minimal_ abstraction: start from nothing and only add the
  behaviours/ideas/operations which are strictly necessary
* "the most exciting thing you can do with your brain is to strap it into the
  hulking exoskeleton of mathematics"
* If you can write a program, you're good at mathematics
