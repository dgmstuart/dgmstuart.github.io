<h3 id="trust-me-im-a-product-manager-case-study-from-publishing">“Trust me, I’m a product manager”: case study from publishing</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Sales thinking: identify influencers, budget holders etc.</li>
  <li>Commercial products: it’s all about profit-and-loss. Non-commercial products
need different KPIs</li>
  <li>Product manager != project manager. Responsible for:
    <ul>
      <li>Backlog, vision statement</li>
      <li>Roadmap: what questions do we need to answer in the next windows of time</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>“You need to go rogue” - prove concepts on your own without a team</li>
  <li>404 test = e.g. buy now button - show it to a % of users, does nothing</li>
  <li>Concierge test = build front-end, but handle the back-end manually</li>
  <li>Everything in the backlog should be in line with the vision statement</li>
  <li>Question for unpicking feature requests which you think might not actually
be about solving a problem: “What happens if you <em>can’t</em> build it?”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-designing-a-new-experience-in-the-nhs-helped-to-unblock-and-unleash-new-potential">How designing a new experience in the NHS helped to unblock and unleash new potential</h3>

<ul>
  <li>His experience: People in localgov/NHS aren’t familiar with agile</li>
  <li>Just because they don’t think of thinks in agile terminology doesn’t mean
they don’t have an agile mindset</li>
  <li>Sexual health services in Lambeth&amp;Southwark are very overstretched, and in
rural areas, round-trip times to visit a clinic might be very long</li>
  <li>Online STI kits - convenient but expensive</li>
  <li>New service: free, user-focussed</li>
  <li>User journeys illustrated with comic-strip style graphics:

  <li>Identify people in the organisation who have an agile mindset and are quite
influential</li>
  <li>Approach: agile prototyping, building a service piece-by-piece with users</li>
  <li>Developing personas</li>
  <li>It’s a digital project, but only 25% of the service being provided is
digital - needs to be recognised</li>
  <li>Started with the basic GDS form</li>
  <li>Prototyping the kits that people recieve - cardboard and post-its
    <ul>
      <li>Started out trying to design engaging packaging for the test kits</li>
      <li>through user testing: learned that people don’t want this - they like a
really simple approach</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Need to think about the user needs of the people receiving the tests as well</li>
  <li>Continuous evaluation on multiple different angles: measuring the impact of
the service on sexual health</li>
  <li>Assumptions broken: people don’t actually want their results to be
super-discreet: they just want to know as quickly and clearly as possible</li>
  <li>Prior to alpha - 3 month discovery stage: very intensive working with users</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Managers are more important if they have more responsibilities - therefore
they’re predjudiced towards bigger projects and bigger products</li>
  <li>PRINCE2 documentation is large regardless of project size - again
predjudicing larger projects</li>
  <li>Project example: Multi-car insurance. users not considered, data produced not
considered, organisational capability to run the service, not considered
(!!)</li>
  <li>On the importance of competitors: “If you’re trying to motivate a project team you need an enemy”</li>
  <li>“The more that you can get product in front of people the better” - internal
and external. The importance of show and tell. “we can show you what’s
possible” - unlock stakeholder committment: low cost, low-risk “If they can
quantify the risk they’ll sign it off”</li>
  <li>Stakeholders probably don’t believe that you can deliver that much in that
little time. Chip away at this by sharing what you’re doing and how you’re
doing it.</li>
  <li>Drew the whole of a product on one A2 flipchart - helped to convince
stakeholders it’s feasible</li>
  <li>Attraction of Waterfall is that it lets you sign off the whole budget. In agile
you’re iterating the budget as well as iterating the project</li>
  <li>Getting everyone speaking the same language is important - e.g. training
stakeholders to not refer to things as ‘portals’ when they’re nothing of the
sort
    <ul>
      <li>If you discover that you’ve got it wrong, or there’s a better term, it
<em>is</em> worth changing it all the way down the stack</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When running agile: Make the work visible - extremely important: whole
backlog on the wall. Makes it much easier to have a common understanding.
Always carry whiteboard markers and post-its when in a non-agile environment
(you won’t find them there).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="techniques-for-overcoming-the-big-7-digital-product-blockers">Techniques for overcoming the Big 7 digital product blockers</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The trap of 100% utilisation: Can’t move quickly. Grind to a halt.</li>
  <li>70% utilisation is about as fast as you can go: helps avoid context-switching</li>
  <li>Intuitive thing when you see someone not busy is to make them busy, but this
slows down all their other projects</li>
  <li>If you’ve got spare time, help unblock <em>other people</em>, or do nothing”: don’t
add more things to the pipeline</li>
  <li>Always be delivering the highest value thing on your most important project</li>
  <li>Optimise ‘batch size’ - grouping together features for deploy. Small batches
= responding to change more quickly. = fixing bugs more easily: if the
problem is a result of code which was written recently, the devs have that
conceptual stack in their head.
    <ul>
      <li>Not achievable if your deployment process is onerous or slow</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>People used to think of environments like pets: they all had names. Today
they’re like cattle: set up when you need it, tear down when you’re done.</li>
  <li>rightscale + ansible + docker: used to spin up 1000 test servers to test
releasing a product to all students in China (which was the MVP!!)
    <ul>
      <li>Cost £10k to run that test but was trivial to set up</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Creating roll-back-able database migrations: dbdeploy, liquibase etc. - have
both database schema versions live in parallel, delete the old one when the
new one is stable</li>
  <li>In closed-scope projects, everyone feels like they need to throw in all
their great feature ideas before the scope window closes - leads to feature
bloat. Solution: get stakeholders on side, and ensure that the product owner
controls the backlog</li>
</ul>
