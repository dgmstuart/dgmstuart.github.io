Hello, I'm Duncan, and I can talk to both people and
computers.

I’m a web programmer. I like
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/),
[Vim](https://github.com/dgmstuart/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc),
and
[Git](https://git-scm.com/)
(among other things).

I believe in sustainable pace, advocating for users and making decisions based on data.

I believe programming is a communications discipline, not an engineering one.

I also believe
[Dave Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Thomas_(programmer))
when he says:
["Agile is Dead (Long Live Agility)"](https://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile.html)

My previous job titles have included Technical Architect, Lead Developer and
Head of Products. Find out where I'm working now on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/duncangmstuart),
or check out my
shiny responsive [CV](https://dgmstuart.github.io/dgms_cv/).

In my spare time I’m mostly swing dancing, sewing or playing board games. I
have a [WordPress blog](https://duncangmstuart.com/) where I
post about that sort of thing sometimes. That blog also has some much older
[code-related posts](https://duncangmstuart.com/category/code/).

One thing I'm particularly proud of is
[Swing Out London](https://www.swingoutlondon.co.uk/):
a listings service for London swing dancers based on a custom CMS which I
built, and ran as a free service before handing over to a team of volunteers
when I left the city. It's been going since 2010 and has had a significant
impact on the scene.
